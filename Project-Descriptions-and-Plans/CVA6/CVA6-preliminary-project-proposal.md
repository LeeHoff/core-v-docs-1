| PPA gate: Project Plan Approved      |                                            |

The goal of this PPL gate is to seek participation of OpenHW members to the CVA6 project and proceed to the PL gate by scoping and planning the project.

## Summary of project

The **CVA6** core is a configurable mid-range application RISC-V core able to boot a rich OS like Linux. Its origin is ETH Zürich's ARIANE core.

From a single RTL source, several flavors can be configured: 32- or 64-bit architecture (**CV32A6** / **CV64A6**),
with or without FPU, with or without MMU, FPGA optimizations...
The ability to have very similar 32- and 64-bit cores should make the transition seamless.

The goal of the project is to bring **CVA6** to an **industrial maturity**:
- Quality documentation
- Add a few features desired by participating members
- High-coverage verification
- Optimizations for FPGA-based products
- SW tools (GCC, LLVM...)
- FPGA prototype and development board
- Linux support

In addition to these industrial goals, a **sustainable open-source solution**, presumably a subset of outputs, will be maintained for researchers,
engineers seeking to evaluate CVA6 and industrial domains that need to support their products for decades.

### Summary of Timeline

The goal is to have all deliverables ready in **June 2022**. A refined planning should be elaborated for the PL gate.

## OpenHW Members/Participants committed to participate in CORE-V IDE project

Confirmed:
- Thales group:
    - Thales Research & Technology (TRT)
    - Thales DIS Design Services (INVIA)
- Hensoldt Cyber
- ETH Zürich

To be confirmed:
- Imperas
- Embecosm
- OpenHW staff
- Futurewei?
- **other members needed**

## Technical Project Leader(s) (TPLs)

- Technical project leader (TPL): Jérôme Quévremont, TRT
- Documentation leader: Florian Zaruba, OpenHW
- Verification leader: Mike Thompson, OpenHW
- _Need identified leaders on other themes/TG?_

## Project Manager (PM)

Three options (starting from the most desired):
1.  Call for participation from an OpenHW member company
    - Thales would like to have participation from more OpenHW partners so encourages this.
    - Staff can assist.
2. PM is OpenHW staff member. 
    - Work closely with the TPL to document the plan.
    - Note that members own this project. In this case, staff PM would be more in background.
3. PM is also Jérôme
    - with support from staff for intergroup coordination and Gantt planning, etc.
    - Jérôme (PM) reports status to TWG.
    - Risky from Thales resource perspective
	
PM role:
-	coordinate and document a project plan (key technical and project steps), 
-	keep track of who is doing what, 
-	plan sprints/waterfall, 
-	identify issues that are blocking the way, 
-	reports issues to TWG, 
-	related to the technical leader role but a bit more toward the planning, tracking and and reporting.

## Summary of requirements

### Introduction

These are requirements identified as of the PPL gate.
They are expected to evolve until the PL gate, as members join and refine the project plan.
The detailed specification will be part of the project itself.

### Initial project requirements 

#### Functional

Compared to the _legacy_ **ARIANE** donated by ETH Zürich:

##### Hensoldt Cyber requirements:

- Support seL4
- `FENCE.T` instruction, <https://github.com/niwis/ariane/tree/fence-t>
- Synchronous resets
- Write-back L1 I+D caches
    - In connection with ETH Zürich

##### Thales requirements:

Configure the core at design-time to get the right performance/area/frequency point:
- Optional RV32 configuration (`XLEN=32` parameter) for embedded applications that are far below the 4 GiB boundaray
    - The large similarity between CV32A6 and CV64A6 should ease the transition and reduce SW rework when jumping to the 64-bit architecture.
- Include or exclude the FPU (RISC-V F and D extensions both for CV32A6 and CV64A6)
- Include or exclude the MMU

Security and functional safety:
- Write-through L1 I+D caches: add a few commands and controls (invalidate/flush, enable/disable, non-cacheable regions, line/way lock, replacement policy,  _to be detailed during specification_)
- Advanced performance counters
- At run-time, ability to disable sources of unpredictability (branch predictions...)

Target ASIC and FPGA products (FPGA not only used as prototypes):
- At design time, select synchronous or asynchronous reset
- Other FPGA optimizations to be identified
    - _Note:_ Thales is co-organizing a student contest in France to get fresh ideas on this topic and promote OpenHW.
	Some elegant student findings might be injected in CV32A6. Thales will act as a firewall between students and OpenHW.

#### License scheme

##### Thales expectactions:

Because of the nature of its business, Thales expectation is to contribute and get a **sustainable open-source solution**
- to integrate CVA6 in new ASIC and FPGA projects for a long period and to maintain/upgrade them for several decades for industrial domains (avionic, satellite, railways, energy…);
- to permit audit and reviews of verification and tools in the context of certifiable security and functional safety;
- to permit public review to improve the quality of the core and its ecosystem;
- to foster cooperative projects and connections with academy and research.

Thereforce, Thales expects:
- Not only the core RTL, but also a version of the simulation environment and the SW tools are available as open-source.
- Commercial tools can be added to this basic set to deliver additional value (improved quality, coverage...).
    - But the project shall not depend on a single-source commercial tool.
	- Commercial tools with multiple sources, such as logic simulators, are acceptable.

In addition, this sustainable open-source solution, removes barriers for newcomers to OpenHW,
as it was the case for ARIANE with the GNU toolchain and the testbench offered by ETH Zürich.
They can evaluate CVA6, adopt it, join OpenHW Group, add their "secret sauce"...

> “Open source tools are the best friends of open hardware.”

#### Verification

OpenHW CEO's expectaction: unified testbench for all CORE-V cores (CVE4, CVA6)

Thales expectactions: Industrial quality:
- High coverage
- Complete package (incl. good quality documentation aligned with verification)
 
Verification leader's expectactions:
- Coverage-driven verification to ensure completeness and quality of results
- Use of SystemVerilog and UVM
- Industrial quality tools
- On-the-fly, in-simulation checking of DUT against a Reference Model
    - Step-and-compare is current technique used
- Ability to offer access and support to non-commercial members of the Open Source community
- Flexibility to support multiple verification components
    - e.g. ISGs, RMs, Scoreboards, etc.

### Future enhancements:

Adding standard or custom extensions, superscalar, SMP multi-core processor, SoC building blocks, architecture generation, build a silicon application processor...

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project

Like RI5CY, the ARIANE core donated by ETH Zürich was at the heart of the OpenHW Group creation. We need an application processor core in our portfolio.

## Industry landscape: description of competing, alternative, or related efforts in the industry

On the core side, these are the most comparable competitors (pipeline length, MMU, single issue...):
- ARM: Cortex-A5
- SiFive: U54
- CHIPS Alliance&nbsp;/ Western Digital: CVA6 between the smaller SweRV  EL2 and the larger EH1.
- ANDES: A25 (32-bit) and AX25 (64-bit)
- Gaisler NOEL-V is more powerful (dual-issue in-order pipeline).

On the tool side, CHIPS Alliance has plans to make their tools open-source
([link](https://semiengineering.com/components-for-open-source-verification/), 5<sup>th</sup> paragraph).

### Related efforts to be described

To differentiate from the competition, marketing can stress the:
- open-source availability,
- the permissive licence scheme,
- the low exposition to export control
([OpenHW Group Membership Agreement](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/openhw-group-membership-agreement-2019-10-16.pdf), section 4.1).

### OpenHW engineering staff resource plan: requirement and availability

The OpenHW staff is expected to support the task groups according to their usual mission.

In addition, specific roles:
- Rick O'Connor: promote the project and attract new participants
- Florian Zaruba: documentation leader
- Mike Thompson: verification leader
- Duncan Bees: TDB w.r.t. the selected PM

The preliminary project plan (last section) shows a dire lack of verification manpower.
Can OpenHW subcontract some tasks if members do not provide enough resources?

## Who would make use of OpenHW output

Any entity needing a mid-range verified open-source RISC-V application processing core for ASIC and FPGA technologies:
- OpenHW members
- Large and small businesses
- Academy and research
- Future OpenHW projects

These users may integrate the CVA6 core both in open-source or closed-source projects. They may also add their "secret sauce".

An open-source project favors collaborative and research projects that can start quickly without commercial and legal burdens.

## Project license model

The project artefacts and outputs will be licensed under Apache 2.0 for SW code and Solderpad 2.0 for HW/RTL codes.

Third-party open-source contributions will generally retain their own licence model.

"Viral" licences, such as GPL, will be avoided.

Imperas will provide the project contributors the necessary licences for the verification. Some verification actors may need several tokens.
