## Summary of project

The **CVA6** core is a configurable mid-range application RISC-V core able to boot a rich OS like Linux. Its origin is ETH Zürich / University of Bologna's ARIANE core.

From a single RTL source, several flavors can be configured: 32- or 64-bit architecture (**CV32A6** / **CV64A6**),
with or without FPU, with or without MMU...

CVA6 targets both **ASIC** and **FPGA soft-core** implementations.

The ability to have very similar 32- and 64-bit cores should make the transition between both quite seamless.

The goal of the project is to bring **CVA6** to an industrial maturity known as **TRL5** (technical readiness level):
- Quality documentation
- Add a few features desired by participating members
- High-coverage verification
- Optimizations for FPGA-based products
- SW tools (GCC, GDB, LLVM\*...)
- FPGA prototype and development board
- Linux and FreeRTOS\* support

\* FreeRTOS and LLVM support are developed in related OpenHW projects.

In addition to these industrial goals, a sustainable open-source solution, presumably a subset of outputs, will be maintained for researchers,
engineers seeking to evaluate CVA6 and industrial domains that need to support their products for decades.

### Summary of Timeline

CVA6 is a long-run project, for which some participants are expecting grants to perform the work needed to reach TRL5. It is therefore difficult to plan the complete project.

Therefore, in order to keep the project under control, the project plan is defined for **2022 activity**. An update of the plan will be needed beginning of 2023, together with another PA gate.

## Project Planning Documents

The 2022 workplan, based on milestones for various contributions and contributors, is below.

The progress towards the milestones will be tracked during progress meetings, usually every two weeks.

## Summary of requirements

### CVA6 features

The CVA6 specification has been prepared for the PA gate.
It is temporarily hosted in this [Google Docs file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rsoO5WKraMCraSpnsVqmt4hJaCcDG0zq7LTWdXVkf0).
After approval by the TWG, it will be converted to AsciiDoc and managed in OpenHW GitHub.

As a summary, CVA6 contains:

|                     | CV64A6                                | CV32A6                           |
| :------------------ | :-----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| ISA                 | RV64IMA\[F\[D\]\]\[C\]_Zicsr_Zifencei | RV32IMA\[F\]\[C\]_Zicsr_Zifencei |
| Privilege levels    | M/S/U\*                               | M/S/U\*                          |
| Virtual memory      | \[Sv39\]                              | \[Sv32\]                         |

\[\] denotes a configurable feature.

\* In addition, CV64A6 will optionally support RISC-V Hypervisor extension.

`FENCE.T` is supported and might become a standard RISC-V instruction in the future.

The **CV-X-IF** interface will allow to extend CVA6 instruction set with an external co-processor.
It will either support proprietary extensions or RISC-V extensions that are not natively supported by CVA6.

### License scheme

Because of the nature of its business, Thales expectation is to contribute and get a **sustainable open-source solution**
- to integrate CVA6 in new ASIC and FPGA projects for a long period and to maintain/upgrade them for several decades for industrial domains (avionic, satellite, railways, energy…);
- to permit audit and reviews of verification and tools in the context of certifiable security and functional safety;
- to permit public review to improve the quality of the core and its ecosystem;
- to foster cooperative projects and connections with academy and research.

Thereforce, Thales expects:
- Not only the core RTL, but also a version of the verification environment and the SW tools are available as open-source.
- Commercial tools can be added to this basic set to deliver additional value (improved quality, coverage...).
    - But the project shall not depend on a single-source commercial tool.
	- Commercial tools with multiple sources, such as logic simulators, are acceptable.

In addition, this sustainable open-source solution, lowers barriers for newcomers to OpenHW. They can evaluate CVA6, adopt it, join OpenHW Group, add their "secret sauce"...

### Verification

To foster cooperation and efficiency within OpenHW Group, CVA6 will use and contribute to **core-v-verif**. Spike will be used as a reference ISS and Imperas OVPSim is considered too.

Gateways between OpenHW core-v-verif repositories and Thales internal environment (GitLab, CI...) will be set up.

## Future enhancements (off project):

Increasing the core architectural performance (dual issue...), adding RISC-V extensions, delivering a larger subsystem (SMP multi-core, peripherals, accelerators...)

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project

Like RI5CY, the ARIANE core donated by ETH Zürich and U. Bologna was at the heart of the OpenHW Group creation. We need an application processor core in our portfolio.

Also, there are very few FPGA technology-independent softcores and CV32A6 is an alternative to proprietary cores.

## Industry landscape: description of competing, alternative, or related efforts in the industry

On the core side, for ASIC targets, these are the most comparable competitors (pipeline length, MMU, single issue...):
- ARM: Cortex-A5
- SiFive: U54
- CHIPS Alliance&nbsp;/ Western Digital: CVA6 between the smaller SweRV  EL2 and the larger EH1.
- ANDES: A25 (32-bit) and AX25 (64-bit)
- Gaisler NOEL-V

On the FPGA side, CV32A6 is a technology-independent alternative to these proprietary cores:
- Xilinx: Microblaze
- MicroChip: Mi-V
- Intel: Nios-II, Nios-V

On the tool side, CHIPS Alliance has plans to make their tools open-source
([link](https://semiengineering.com/components-for-open-source-verification/), 5<sup>th</sup> paragraph).

### Market differentiators

_This section was initially titled "Related efforts to be described"._

To differentiate from the competition, marketing can stress:
- Source code written in SystemVerilog, a widely accepted language;
- Open-source availability of the core;
- Open-source availability of verification artefacts, which is a great step towards certification for security- and safety-critical applications;
- The availability of a family of technology-independent cores optimized for ASIC and FPGA targets;
- The ability to extend the instruction set thanks to the CV-X-IF interface;
- The SW ecosystem running on CVA6, with FreeRTOS and Linux already demonstrated;
- The ability to scale to SMP multi/many-core CPUs thanks to the OpenPiton framework;
- The permissive licence scheme that allows the integration in open-source or closed-source projects or the addition of a "secret sauce";
- The low exposition to export control
([OpenHW Group Membership Agreement](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/openhw-group-membership-agreement-2019-10-16.pdf), section 4.1).

## External dependencies

The project relies on:
- Related OpenHW projects (joint with other cores): LLVM, FreeRTOS, core-v-verif, CV-X-IF specification
- Open-source software: GCC, GDB, LLVM, Linux (Yocto, BuildRoot), OpenSBI, UBoot, BBL...
- Open-source verification: Google Riscv-dv, Spike, RISC-V compatibility tests
- Open-source hardware: fpnew (ETH Zürich, soon migrated to OpenHW)
- Eclipse Foundation, GitHub
- Digilent Genesys 2 board
- JADE Design Automation's Register Manager
- Simulators: Verilator (open-source), Siemens Questa, Synopsys VCS, Imperas OVPSim
- Synthesis: Vivado (Xilinx), Synopsys Design Compiler (ASIC)

CVA6 can be integrated in the OpenPiton framework to build an SMP multi/many-core CPU.

The RV32F DIV and SQRT simulation sequences will be developed as early as possible so that they can be reused by CV32E40Pv2 project.

### Project tracking and meetings

The progress towards 2022 milestones will be tracked in progress meetings. Slides will be updated during the meeting and posted on CVA6 Mattermost channel.

The various activities (core, verification, software) are led in a unified project way and reported to the relevant task groups.

The CVA6 meets every week, alternating progress and technical meetings.
The meetings are well suited for East Coast, Europe and India timezones. Once a month, the meeting starts later to accomodate participants from the West Coast.

### Oustanding topics

These topics will be defined in CVA6 meetings at the relevant time:
- Overall approach for Github issues and label

No release plan is defined in 2022 as this PA gate is interim.
No Project Freeze (PF) checklist is planned in 2022.
