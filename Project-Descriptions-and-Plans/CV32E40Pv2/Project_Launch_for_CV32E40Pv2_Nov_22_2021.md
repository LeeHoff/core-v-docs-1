# OpenHW Project Launch Proposal: CV32E40Pv2

# Title of Project - "CV32E40Pv2"
# Project Launch Proposal
## Date of proposal - 2021-11-22
## Author(s) - Pascal Gouedo (Dolphin Design), Olivier Montfort (Dolphin Design), Yoann Pruvost (Dolphin Design)


## Summary of project
This proposal is about verifying PULP basic instructions disabled during CV32E40Pv1 phase.
The goal of these instructions is to improve performance, power consumption and even code size depending of application programs.

### Components of the Project

This project will start from CV32E40P RTL freeze tag cv32e40p_v1.0.0 made in December 10, 2020.

To be fully compliant with RISC-V ISA, re-encode all PULP instructions in custom-0 to 3 RISC-V extensions (today disseminated in standard extensions)
and verify all re-encoded [PULP instructions](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p/blob/master/docs/source/instruction_set_extensions.rst):
* Post-increment and register-register indexed load/store
* Hardware loops
* General ALU extensions
* Immediate branch
* Multiply-accumulate
* Bit manipulation
* SIMD (16 and 8-bit data) 
* Event load

Single Precision Floating Point support
* Keep Floating Point instructions decoding inside the Core and dispatch their execution to APU interface.
* Use ETHZ FPnew as FP execution unit (or FPnew moved to CV-FPU OpenHW Group project?)
* Verify RISC-V F extension instructions with coupled Core-FPnew (in both Zfinx and non-Zfinx modes?)
* Keep it optional with a parameter

For Multicore cluster area reduction
* Verify PULP Zfinx
* Keep it optional with a parameter to be able to use standard SW toolchain not supporting Zfinx (comment: not mandatory for Dolphin but anyone else?)

#### Component 1 - RTL design

Same RTL delivery than CV32E40Pv1 but with following parameters settings:
* Support of PULP ISA Extension (incl. custom CSRs and hardware loop, excl. p.elw)
  PULP_XPULP   = 1
* Support of PULP Cluster specific features (Event Load, global clock gating,...)
  PULP_CLUSTER = 1
* Optional Support of RISC-V F extension (interfaced via APU interface)
  FPU          = 0 or 1
* Optional support of PULP Zfinx if FPU = 1
  PULP_ZFINX   = 0 or 1

So 3 different configurations will be verified:
* PULP_XPULP = 1, PULP_CLUSTER = 1, FPU = 0
* PULP_XPULP = 1, PULP_CLUSTER = 1, FPU = 1, PULP_ZFINX = 0
* PULP_XPULP = 1, PULP_CLUSTER = 1, FPU = 1, PULP_ZFINX = 1

#### Component 2 - Documentation
See "Project Documents" section

## Summary of market or input requirements
### Known market/project requirements at PL gate


### Potential future enhancements for future project phases

## Who would make use of OpenHW output
Companies needing more performances, less power consumption or smaller code size for standard control or DSP-like computing applications.

## Summary of Timeline
All tasks and their estimated workload are listed in [CV32E40pv2 task list](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/program/Project-Descriptions-and-Plans/CV32E40Pv2/CV32E40Pv2-task-list.xlsx).

Whole project is estimated between 14 and 20 person.months

With 2 verification and 1 architecture/documentation/design resources, given the project would start in January 2022, RTL freeze and release would be expected end of Q2 2022.

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project
* Finalize CV32E40 as originally intended in the [CV32E40 Features and Parameters](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/cores/cv32e40p/CV32E40P_and%20CV32E40_Features_Parameters.pdf) to propose a more powerful/optimized version of CV32E40.

## Description of initial code contribution, if required

Core RTL
* Initial code contribution is from the existing CV32E40Pv1 release already approved by the IP team. 
* Does PULP instructions and Features need to be reviwed by IP Team?
FPU RTL
* Initial FPU code contribution is from the existing ETHZ FPnew RTL.
* Does it need to be reviewed by IP Team?

Verification based on core-v-verif uvm environment.

## Repository Requirements
* Design and Documentation will use https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p
* Verification and Reports will use https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif

## Project distribution model
* OpenHW GitHub Repository

## Preliminary Project plan
*A full project plan is not required at PL. A preliminary plan, which can be for instance the schedule for completion of component or feature list, together with responsible resource, should be provided. Full details should be provided at PA gate.*

## Plan toward PA gate
When are the planned milestones?
* PA – Plan approved – a fully detailed project plan and an agreed requirements specification as component of the User Manual
e/o Q4 2021

* PF – Project Freeze – Code released, all project checklists completed , and project completed
e/o Q2 2022

## Risk Register
* Avaibility of SW toolchain supporting all PULP instructions and PULP Zfinx
* Avaibility of ISS supporting all PULP instructions and PULP Zfinx
* Avaibility of OneSpin RISC-V app supporting Zfinx
