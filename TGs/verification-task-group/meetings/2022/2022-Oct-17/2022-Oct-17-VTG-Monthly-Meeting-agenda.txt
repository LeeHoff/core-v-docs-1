OpenHW: VTG Meeting 17th Oct
----------------------------
Intro by new chair
5 min update for each project from leaders of verification for each core undergoing verification:
	CV32E40X
	CV32E40S
	CV32E40Pv2
	CVA6
	CV32E20
update on core-v-verif projects: Mike
Introduction to first 3 Advanced RISC-V Verification Methodologies projects
	ARVM-FunctionalCoverage
		developing open-source VIPs (such as functional coverage) that can be used for many different core configurations/implementations
	ARVM-Standards
		defining and implementing evolving interface standards for test bench components to enable better test bench component reuse and potentially stimulate availability of compatible VIPs
	ARVM-TestbenchQuality
		developing quality measurement of test benches - so quality of cores can be predicted (for example defining fault models and tests and relating those to TRL levels)
