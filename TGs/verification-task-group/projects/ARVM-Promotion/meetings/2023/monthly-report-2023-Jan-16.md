# **ARVM-Promotion** Monthly Report for 16-January-2023

Participating companies : OpenHW members

## Overview
Educating and informing processor verification teams of choices and techniques available across the RISCV community and verification ecosystem (for example conference talks, tutorials and videos).

Purpose is to provide more information on RISC-V verification.

## Current Status
Many members actively promoting RISC-V Verification - though we always need more...

## Issues / items that are slowing progress
- need more members, companies, organizations talking publicly about verification
- please post on matter most upcoming talks and other promotions...

## Future conference papers/presentations
- HiPEAC - Jan 2023  
    - "The evolution of RISC-V and the adoption of new open verification standards" (Imperas)  
    - Panel: "European RISC-V in HPC prospective" (SemiDynamics, Codasip, Cortus, Imperas)
