# **ARVM-SocIntegration** Monthly Report for 21-November-2022

Project leader : Simon Davidmann   
Lead company :  Imperas  
Participating companies : (initial discussions with non-member Breker)

## Overview
To consider requirements and solutions for SoC core integration verification (for example cache coherency with uncore components)

## Current Status
Starting to have discussion on graph based test program generation like PSS and Breker

Current view:  
There are several levels of verification (read from bottom):
- SoC integration level - verifying the integration of the core IP - SoC level integration test
- core DV level - verifying at micro-architecture level - is the implementation good
- core compliance level - basically ISA - has the spec been understood - verifying architecture understanding  

## Key activities / tasks completed this month
- had initial discussions 

Still early days - just starting to collect information  


## Planned activities / tasks for coming month
- Imperas and Breker(currently non-member of OpenHW) have paper at RISC-V Summit in Dec. 
    - "The New Verification Ecosystem that Supports RISC-V Verification for all Adopters."
    
## Issues / items that are slowing progress
- none - just starting up...

## Other information
