# **ARVM-SocIntegration** Monthly Report for 16-January-2023

Project leader : Simon Davidmann   
Lead company :  Imperas  
Participating companies : (starting exploring working with non-member Breker)

## Overview
To consider requirements and solutions for SoC core integration verification (for example cache coherency with uncore components)

## Current Status
Starting to have discussion on graph based test program generation like PSS and Breker

Current view:  
There are several levels of verification (read from bottom):
- SoC integration level - verifying the integration of the core IP - SoC level integration test
- core DV level - verifying at micro-architecture level - is the implementation good
- core compliance level - basically ISA - has the spec been understood - verifying architecture understanding  

## Key activities / tasks completed this month
- had further discussions 
- created demonstration between processor core and SoC and memory coherency tests
- presentation and demonstrations at RISC-V Summit Dec 2022
    - "The New Verification Ecosystem that Supports RISC-V Verification for all Adopters" (Breker, Imperas)
        - [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGfHeccfOfA)

- Still early days - just starting to collect information  and try things and get ecosystem feedback


## Planned activities / tasks for coming month
- on going discussions
    
## Issues / items that are slowing progress
- none - just starting up...

## Other information
